Taxi drivers are undoubtedly hard-working professionals that work long hours without many breaks in between. To help facilitate breaks in between shifts, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) in conjunction with the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has created exclusive parking spaces for drivers. These spaces allow drivers to temporarily leave their vehicle, stretch their legs, eat, and use the restroom. The problem is that there is a disconnect between the drivers and the DOT. The information was not properly distributed to the drivers in a way drivers could access this information while on the road. Here is the [original listing](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/taxirelief.shtml) of taxi relief stands created by the DOT. This information is useful but extremely difficult for a driver to navigate, especially while driving.




## A New Way To Navigate
Through many months of online and in-field research, I created a more refined list with relevant information for drivers about each stand. This information includes an estimated amount of parking spaces, hours/limits space is available, public restrooms, restaurants nearby, subway stations, and a lot more.

## Several Types of Stands
There are 4 types of stands spread across NYC, and they allow specific privileges to certain types of vehicles.
