Hi there! Iâ€™m Jacky, a data-loving data analyst. My passion for data began in 2016 while working for the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission. For over three years, I worked on researching and implementing policies that affect the lives of over 8 million New Yorkers with a data-driven approach. I created this site to be the home for my work and personal projects.

I studied Business Administration at Queens College and enlisted in the military after finishing my undergraduate degree. I spent three years in the New York Army National Guard as an [Air Battle Management System Operator.] (https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/combat/air-defense-battle-management-system-operator.html) After completing my military service, I worked as a consultant for the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, where I oversaw the data collection of a citywide initiative called [Trees Count! 2015.] (http://media.nycgovparks.org/images/web/TreesCount/Index.html) At the time, I was unaware of the possibilities this [dataset offered.] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh) Instead, I was focused on creating a strong team and leveraging my leadership experience from the military. Little did I know, this experience served as the precursor for my love in data. Please take a look around and feel free to get in [touch] (mailto:ny.jackylam@gmail.com) with me!
