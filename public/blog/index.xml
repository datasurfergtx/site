      <description>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is a federal agency responsible for taking care of US military personnel after they separated from service. The VA provides healthcare, education, disability, and other benefits to US veterans. The VA also has a lot of data on US veterans available for free. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of spreadsheets and pivot tables on veteran population. The data is given in county format, which is good for our analysis later, but we need to aggregate the data to view it at a state level.</description>

These spaces allow drivers to temporarily leave their vehicle, stretch their legs, eat, and use the restroom. The problem is that there is a disconnect between the drivers and the DOT.</description>
