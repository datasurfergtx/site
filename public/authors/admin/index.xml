      <description>Hi there! Iâ€™m Jacky, a data-loving transportation policy analyst. My passion for data began in 2016 while working for the NYC Taxi &amp;amp; Limousine Commission. For the past three years, I worked on researching and implementing policies that affect the lives of over 8 million New Yorkers with a data-driven approach. I created this site to be the home for my work and personal projects.
I studied Business Administration at Queens College and enlisted in the military after finishing my undergraduate degree.</description>
