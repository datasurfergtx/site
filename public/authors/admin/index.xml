      <description>I was curious to know what the veteran population was like in the United States, so I went onto the Department of Veterans Affairs website and found a bunch of spreadsheets and pivot tables on veteran population. The data is given in county format, which is good for our analysis later, but we need to aggregate it to look at it in a state level.

      <description>Hi there! Iâ€™m Jacky, a data-loving transportation policy analyst. My passion for data began in 2016 while working for the NYC Taxi &amp;amp; Limousine Commission. For the past three years, I worked on researching and implementing policies that affect the lives of over 8 million New Yorkers with a data-driven approach. I created this site to be the home for my work and personal projects.
I studied Business Administration at Queens College and enlisted in the military after finishing my undergraduate degree.</description>
