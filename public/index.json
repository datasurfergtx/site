The VA provides healthcare, education, disability, and other benefits to US veterans. The VA also has a lot of data on US veterans available for free. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of spreadsheets and pivot tables on veteran population. The data is given in county format, which is good for our analysis later, but we need to aggregate the data to view it at a state level.\nUS Veteran Population Density in 2015 Here is a breakdown of veteran population density across the US in 2015. We can see that most veterans live in California, Texas, and Florida.\n\nNew York Veteran Population Density in 2015 Now that we have an idea of the veteran population in the US, let\u0026rsquo;s look more closely at a particular state to see if we can draw any insights on this dataset. The above map shows a raw count of veterans in New York. Suffolk County and Erie County have the most veterans. However, this map can be a little misleading. There are a lot of veterans living in these counties but we do not know anything about the overall population density in each county. Let\u0026rsquo;s take some census data and build out veteran proportion in each country.\n\nNew York Veteran Population by percentage Now we can see that Jefferson and Hamilton County have the most veterans by percentage of population within the county. A little Google search found that there\u0026rsquo;s a VA in both Hamilton County and Jefferson County! VA in Hamilton County\nVA in Jefferson County\n\nImportance of Visualization Visualizing this dataset helped us understand that areas with the highest proportion of veterans do not happen by chance. More veterans will live nearby a VA. I think this approach would be useful for the VA if they have plans to build new VA hospitals or offices that provide benefits to veterans.\nRecent Posts  Creating a Practical Tool for Taxi/Uber Driver  Tutorials:  Explorartory Analysis on Uber Data  ","date":1543550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543550400,"objectID":"52ea893b69f71d170083cfce35828943","permalink":"/blog/veterans/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/blog/veterans/","section":"blog","summary":"Drawing insights on population through data visualization.","tags":null,"title":"Visualizing Veteran Population","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Jacky Lam"],"categories":["Data Visualization","GIS"],"content":" Taxi drivers are undoubtedly hard-working professionals that work long hours without many breaks in between. To help facilitate breaks in between shifts, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) in conjunction with the NYC Taxi \u0026amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) has created exclusive parking spaces for drivers. These spaces allow drivers to temporarily leave their vehicle, stretch their legs, eat, and use the restroom. The problem is that there is a disconnect between the drivers and the DOT. The information was not properly distributed to the drivers in a way drivers could access this information while on the road. Here is the original listing of taxi relief stands created by the DOT. This information is useful but extremely difficult for a driver to navigate, especially while driving.\nA New Way To Navigate Through many months of online and in-field research, I created a more refined list with relevant information for drivers about each stand. This information includes an estimated amount of parking spaces, hours/limits space is available, public restrooms, restaurants nearby, subway stations, and a lot more.\n  Several Types of Stands There are 4 types of stands spread across NYC, and they allow specific privileges to certain types of vehicles.\nDisclaimer: This information is not considered an official source of information.\n Taxi Stand: Taxi drivers can wait in their vehicle and pick up passengers. Taxi Relief Stand: Taxi drivers are allowed to park their vehicles for up to one hour. Taxi/FHV Relief Stand: Taxi and FHV drivers are allowed to park their vehicles for up to one hour. FHV Only: FHV drivers are allowed to park their vehicles for up to one hour.  \nThe map has been featured on Uber\u0026rsquo;s webpage.

You can find the dataset and a bunch more on Kaggle or click here.\nOnce you have your data, import it, look at the data structure. We\u0026rsquo;re also going to use the tidyverse package for this tutorial.\nstr(uber) $ Date.Time: Factor w/ 42907 levels \u0026quot;9/1/2014 0:00:00\u0026quot;,..: 2 2 4 7 12 13 16 17 33 34 ... $ Lat : num 40.2 40.8 40.8 40.7 40.8 ... $ Lon : num -74 -74 -74 -74 -73.9 ... $ Base : Factor w/ 5 levels \u0026quot;B02512\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B02598\u0026quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...  Notice that the datetime is a factor and it does not follow the ISO 8601 standard. R likes reading datetimes in this format. The data structure in R is called POSIXct or POSIXlt. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to get into the details of it but just know that when you run an str() POSIXct or POSIXlt is preferable. You will run into a bunch of problems if it is otherwise.\n   Date.Time Lat Lon Base     9/1/2014 0:01:00 40.2201 -74.0021 B02512   9/1/2014 0:01:00 40.7500 -74.0027 B02512   9/1/2014 0:03:00 40.7559 -73.9864 B02512   9/1/2014 0:06:00 40.7450 -73.9889 B02512   9/1/2014 0:11:00 40.8145 -73.9444 B02512   9/1/2014 0:12:00 40.6735 -73.9918 B02512    Clean Datetime There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of different ways to clean up datatimes but the method is more or less the same:\n Convert factor to character  uber$Date.Time = as.character(uber$Date.Time)   Use a datetime function to convert from chr to POSIXct/POSIXlt  uber$Date.Time = strptime(uber$Date.Time, \u0026quot;%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S\u0026quot;) #base r parse_date_time(uber$Date.Time, order = 'mdy HMS') #readr package  strptime() is very fast but is not flexible with weird date formats. It will work fine for this dataset. Below is a chart of datetime formats you will encounter and how you should specify your datetime when you convert it in strptime()\nDatetime formats    R Format Meaning R Format Meaning     %a Abbreviated weekday %A Full weekday   %b Abbreviated month %B Full month   %c Locale-specific date and time %d Decimal date   %H Decimal hours (24 hour) %I Decimal hours (12 hour)   %j Decimal day of the year %m Decimal month   %M Decimal minute %p Locale-specific AM/PM   %S Decimal second %U Decimal week of the year (starting on Sunday)   %w Decimal Weekday (0=Sunday) %W Decimal week of the year (starting on Monday)   %x Locale-specific Date %X Locale-specific Time   %y 2-digit year %Y 4-digit year   %z Offset from GMT %Z Time zone (character)    parse_date_time is a more forgiving datetime function. It accepts a wider range of datetime formats and you will not need to use the chart above to specify your datetimes. However, this makes the function a lot slower to work with. If your datetime follows some kind of uniform pattern, strptime() will work just fine.\nAggregate Data Let\u0026rsquo;s look at trip volume per day by base.\n Extract date from datetime:  uber$date = substr(uber$Date.Time, 1,10)  date is now a chr, convert it to POSIXlt:  uber$date = strptime(uber$date, \u0026quot;%Y-%m-%d\u0026quot;)  Aggregate the data:  table(uber$date,uber$Base)      Date B02512 B02598 B02617 B02682 B02764     2014-09-01 638 4626 7940 3677 3080   2014-09-02 1188 6970 11642 5729 3302   2014-09-03 1284 8079 13019 6462 3787   2014-09-04 1513 9412 15185 7670 4580   2014-09-05 1808 10036 16472 8660 5343   2014-09-06 1580 9848 15573 8132 5387   2014-09-07 1124 7122 11639 5983 4266   \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;    We might want this to be in a data frame, so we can play around with it.\n trips = data.frame(table(uber$date,uber$Base))  Notice that our data is saved in a long format. It\u0026rsquo;s not as nicely formatted as the chart above. We\u0026rsquo;ll revisit this later when we graph our data.  trips = spread(trips,Var2,Freq) This reformats our data nicely.  Now our data frame should look something like the chart above but the date is named Var1. colnames(trips[1]) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;date\u0026quot; That should fix it!\nGraph Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to graph. You want your data in a long format like what trips = data.frame(table(uber$date,uber$Base)) gave you. You can just re-run this code or you can use gather() function to bring our data frame back to it\u0026rsquo;s original state. graph = gather(trips,'B02512','B02598', 'B02682', 'B02764', 'B02617', key = \u0026quot;Base\u0026quot;, value = \u0026quot;Trips\u0026quot;)\n   date Base Trips     2014-09-01 B02512 638   2014-09-02 B02512 1188   2014-09-03 B02512 1284   2014-09-04 B02512 1513   2014-09-05 B02512 1808   2014-09-06 B02512 1580    It looks like our dates are back into factors. No worries, since we\u0026rsquo;re already in the ISO 8601 format, converting is a breeze. graph$date = as.POSIXct(as.character(graph$date))\nAfter all our hard work, we can finally graph our data! ggplot(graph, aes(x = Date, y = Trips, color = as.factor(Base))) + geom_line() \nBlog Posts  Creating a Practical Tool for Taxi/Uber Driver Visualizing Veteran Population  ","date":1536552000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536552000,"objectID":"6f62b4d47b401254d44d2726a97bdb2d","permalink":"/tutorial/uber-data/","publishdate":"2018-09-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/uber-data/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial we\u0026rsquo;re going to:\n Import Data Clean Datetime Aggregate Data Graph  Import Data The dataset we will be working on today will be uber\u0026rsquo;s NYC September 2014 dataset.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target.
