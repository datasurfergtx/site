The VA provides healthcare, education, disability, and other benefits to US veterans. The VA also has a lot of data on US veterans available for free. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of spreadsheets and pivot tables on veteran population. The data is given in county format, which is good for our analysis later, but we need to aggregate the data to view it at a state level.\nUS Veteran Population Density in 2015 Here is a breakdown of veteran population density across the US in 2015. We can see that most veterans live in California, Texas, and Florida.\n\nNew York Veteran Population Density in 2015 Now that we have an idea of the veteran population in the US, let\u0026rsquo;s look more closely at a particular state to see if we can draw any insights on this dataset. The above map shows a raw count of veterans in New York. Suffolk County and Erie County have the most veterans. However, this map can be a little misleading. There are a lot of veterans living in these counties but we do not know anything about the overall population density in each county. Let\u0026rsquo;s take some census data and build out veteran proportion in each country.\n\nNew York Veteran Population by percentage Now we can see that Jefferson and Hamilton County have the most veterans by percentage of population within the county. A little Google search found that there\u0026rsquo;s a VA in both Hamilton County and Jefferson County! VA in Hamilton County\nVA in Jefferson County\n\nImportance of Visualization Visualizing this dataset helped us understand that areas with the highest proportion of veterans do not happen by chance. More veterans will live nearby a VA. I think this approach would be useful for the VA if they have plans to build new VA hospitals or offices that provide benefits to veterans.\n\nResources: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html\nhttp://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=927\nhttps://www.va.gov/vetdata/\n","date":1543550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543550400,"objectID":"52ea893b69f71d170083cfce35828943","permalink":"https://jackylam.io/blog/veterans/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/blog/veterans/","section":"blog","summary":"Drawing insights on population through data visualization.","tags":null,"title":"Visualizing Veteran Population","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://jackylam.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://jackylam.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"https://jackylam.io/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database.
